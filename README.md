 Overview
Web security is a growing concern as millions of websites remain vulnerable to cyber threats. WebCheck is an intelligent real-time vulnerability scanner designed to help developers, businesses, and users identify security risks in their web applications.

🔍 The Problem
Web applications are exposed to various threats such as:
❌ SQL Injection – Unauthorized database access
❌ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – Malicious script injection
❌ Weak Content Security Policy (CSP) – Open to data leaks
❌ Outdated Dependencies – Prone to exploits

Without a proactive approach, these issues lead to data breaches, website defacement, and financial losses.

💡 The Solution
WebCheck offers a seamless AI-powered web security scanner that:
✅ Analyzes website security in real-time
✅ Detects vulnerabilities & misconfigurations
✅ Provides actionable recommendations
✅ Alerts users of critical threats

Built to be fast, efficient, and easy to use, WebCheck ensures web applications remain secure and resilient against cyber attacks.
